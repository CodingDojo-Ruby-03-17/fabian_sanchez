Assignment- Wizard, Ninja, Samurai
==================================

Objective: We will be creating three different classes that all inherit from
the Human class we created.

In a separate files (wizard.rb, ninja.rb and samurai.rb) create the following
custom attributes and methods for each corresponding class:

  > Wizard should have a default health of 50 and intelligence of 25
  > Wizard should have a method called heal, which when invoked, heals the
  > Wizard by 10 Wizard should have a method called fireball, which when
    invoked, decrease the health of whichever object it attacked by 20
  > Ninja should have a default stealth of 175
  > Ninja should have a steal method which, when invoked, attacks an object
    and increases the Ninja's health by 10
  > Ninja should have a get_away method which, when invoked, decreases its
    health by 15
  > Samurai should have a default health of 200
  > Samurai should have method called death_blow, which when invoked, attacks
    an object and decreases its health to 0
  > Samurai should have a method called meditate, which when invoked, heals
    the Samurai back to full health
  > Samurai should have a class method called how_many, which when invoked,
    displays how many Samurai's there are.

The classes test code is located in file warriors_test.rb
