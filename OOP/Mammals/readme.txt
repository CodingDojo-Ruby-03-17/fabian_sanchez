Assignment- Lion
=========================

Objective: Now, create another class called Lion that inherits from Mammal.

  > Have the default health be 170
  > Add a new method called fly, which when invoked, decreases the health by 10.
  > Add a new method called attack_town, which when invoked, decreases the
    health by 50.
  > Add a new method called eat_humans, which when invoked, increases the
    health by 20.

Test: Have the Lion attack_town three times, eat_humans twice, fly twice, and
have it display its health. When the Lion's display_health method is called
have it say 'This is a lion` before it displays the default information (make
sure you still call the parent's display_health function).
